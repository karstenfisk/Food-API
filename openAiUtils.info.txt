You will notice a missing openAiUtils file in this repository. I have decided to exclude it to keep the prompt engineering to myself. However, below I will provide steps needed to create your own openAiUtils file.

1. Create generateRecipe function.
2. Create generatePrompt function.
3. Configure prompt and recipe generators to receive objects in this format:
     generateRecipe({
       diet: "Any",
       prepTime: "Any",
       cuisine: "Any",
       macros: {
       protein: "4 g",
       fats: "0 g",
       carbohydrates: "0 g",
       calories: "800",
     },
       ingredients: ["Egg"],
     });
4. Parse OpenAI Response into valid json format like so:
    {
        title: string,
        ingredients: [string]
        instructions: [string]
        macros: {protein: string, fats: string, carbohydrates: string, calories: string}
    }
